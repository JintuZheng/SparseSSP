# SparseSSP: 3D Subcellular Structure Prediction from Sparse-View Transmitted Light Images
Official Pytorch implementation for SparseSSP, an efficient framework, predicting fluorescent intensities within the target voxel grid in an efficient paradigm instead of relying entirely on 3D topologies.

The code will be coming soon.
